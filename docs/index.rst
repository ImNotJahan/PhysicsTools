physics_utils documentation
===========================

physics_utils is a package designed for automating tedious tasks which
come with physics labs. Notably is the automatic handling of uncertainty
propagation, done through the ``MeasuredData`` class, which can then be
used with other modules for worryfree error bars on graphs and such.
